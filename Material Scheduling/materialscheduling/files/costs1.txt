These are costs.  The program knows which is which.  The list is organized as
follows:

Cost per KWH of electricity
Cost per cu.ft. of oxygen
Cost per minute of furnace time
Cost per 1% yield for RGO products
Cost per 1% yield for TCH products
Cost per 1% yield for CRNO products
Cost per 1% yield for CHROME products
Cost per 1% yield for CRNI products
Cost per 1% yield for CARBON products

The program will automatically read the first three into the appropriate places. 
Then, depending on whether a 1..5 is sent in with the object constructor, one of
the last five is read in to the appropriate place.

The constructor requires a parameter from 1..5; this can also be accomplished
by sending one of the following symbolic constants instead of a number.
0 = UNCLASSIFIED
1 = RGO
2 = TCH
3 = CRNO
4 = CHROME
5 = CRNI
